module Stratify
where

-- |Given a list representing a logical \"separator\", and a
-- list that may contain occurrences of this separator,
-- 'stratify' returns a list of the (possibly empty)
-- subsequences \"between\" instances of the separator.
-- 
-- 'stratify' is the inverse of 'intercalate'.
-- 
-- >  intercalate s (stratify s l) == l
-- 
-- Also
-- 
-- >  stratify s (intercalate s l) == l
-- 
-- except in the cases where 'intercalate' loses
-- information.  These are:
-- 
--    (1) When @l == [[]]@
-- 
--    (2) When @s == []@
-- 
--    (3) When @s@ overlaps the elements of @l@ in such a way as to
--        add extra occurrences of @s@.
-- 
-- \"Intercalated\: A body of material interbedded or
-- interlaminated with another.\"
-- 
-- \"Stratified\: A term applied to rocks deposited in
-- nearly horizontal layers or strata on the earth's
-- surface.\"
